# 2013 Coursera Machine Learning Coursework

This repository contains all the practice material, and my completed code, for the Coursera course on Machine Learning that I took in 2013. The instructor was Andrew Ng.

The homework lessons are contained in the folders "ex1" through "ex8". A description of each lesson can be found in the .pdf file contained in each lesson folder. Source code is written in Matlab/Octave .m files.

For the code that I wrote myself, look for the comment blocks labeled "YOUR CODE HERE".
